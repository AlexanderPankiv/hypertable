#### Description
<p>
`CREATE TABLE` creates a table with the given name.  A table consists of a set
of column family and access group specifications.
### Column Families
<p>
Column families are somewhat analogous to a traditional database column.  The
main difference is that a theoretically infinite number of qualified columns
can be created within a column family.  The qualifier is an optional NUL-
terminated string that can be supplied, along with the data, in the insert
statement.  This is what gives tables in Hypertable their sparse nature.  For
example, given a column family "tag", the following set of qualified columns
may be inserted for a single row.

 * `tag:good`
 * `tag:science`
 * `tag:authoritative`
 * `tag:green`

The column family is represented internally as a single byte, so there is a
limit of 255 column families (the 0 value is reserved) which may be supplied in
the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
### Access Groups
<p>
Tables consist of one or more access groups, each containing some number of
column families.  There is a default access group named "default" which
contains all column families that are not explicitly referenced in an ACCESS
GROUP clause.  For example, the following two statements are equivalent.
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre><code>
 CREATE TABLE foo (
   a,
   b,
   c,
   ACCESS GROUP bar ( a, b ) 
 )
</code></pre>
</td valign="top">
<td>
<pre><code>
 CREATE TABLE foo (
   a,
   b,
   c,
   ACCESS GROUP bar (a, b),
   ACCESS GROUP default (c) 
 )
</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Access groups provide control over the physical layout of the table data on
disk.  The data for all column families in the same access group are stored
physically together on disk.  By carefully defining a set of access groups and
choosing which column families go into those access groups, performance can be
significantly improved for expected workloads.  For example, say you have a
table with 100 column families, but two of the column families get access
together with much higher frequency than the rest of the 98 column families.
By putting the two frequently accessed column families in their own access
group, the system does much less disk i/o because only the data for the two
column families gets transfered whenever those column families are accessed.  A
row-oriented database can be emulated by having a single access group.  A
column-oriented database can be emulated by having each column family within
their own access group.
### Table Options
<p>
The following table options are supported:

  * `MAX_VERSIONS '=' int`
  * `TTL '=' duration`
  * `IN_MEMORY`
  * `BLOCKSIZE '=' int`
  * `COMPRESSOR '=' compressor_spec`

These are the same options as the ones in the column family and access group
specification except that they act as defaults in the case where no
corresponding option is specified in the column family or access group
specifier.  See the description under Access Group Options for option details.
### Column Family Options
<p>
The following column family options are supported:

  * `MAX_VERSIONS '=' int`
  * `TTL '=' duration`

Cells in a table are specified by not only a row key and a qualified column,
but also a timestamp.  This allows for essentially multiple timestamped version
s of each cell.  Cells are kept stored in reverse chronological order of
timestamp and the `MAX_VERSIONS` allows you to specify that you only want to
keep the n most recent versions of each cell.  Older versions are lazily
garbage collected through the normal compaction process.

The `TTL` option allows you to specify that you only want to keep cell versions
that fall within some time window in the immediate past.  For example, you can
specify that you only want to keep cells that were created within the past two
weeks.  Like the `MAX_VERSIONS` option, older versions are lazily garbage
collected through the normal compaction process.
### Access Group Options
<p>
The following access group options are supported:

  * `IN_MEMORY`
  * `BLOCKSIZE '=' int`
  * `COMPRESSOR '=' compressor_spec`
  * `BLOOMFILTER '=' bloom_filter_spec`

The `IN_MEMORY` option indicates that all cell data for the access group should
remain memory resident.  Queries against column families in IN_MEMORY access
groups are efficient because no disk access is required.

The cell data inserted into an access group resides in one of two places.  The
recently inserted cells are stored in an in-memory data structure called the
cell cache and older cells get compacted into on-disk data structures called
cell stores.  The cell stores are organized as a series of compressed blocks of
sorted key/value pairs (cells).  At the end of the compressed blocks is a block
index which contains, for each block, the key (row,column,timestamp) of the
last cell in the block, followed by the block offset.  It also contains a Bloom
Filter.

The `BLOCKSIZE` option controls the size of the compressed blocks in the cell
stores.  A smaller block size minimizes the amount of data that must be read
from disk and decompressed for a key lookup at the expense of a larger block
index which consumes memory.  The default value for the block size is 65K.

The `COMPRESSOR` option specifies the compression codec that should be used for
cell store blocks within an access group.  See the Compressors section below
for a description of each compression codec.

<em>NOTE: if the block, after compression, is not significantly reduced in
size, then no compression will be performed on the block</em>

An access group can consist of many on-disk cell stores.  A query for a single
row key can result probing each cell store to see if data is present for that
row even when most of the cell stores do not contain any data for that row.
To eliminate this inefficiency, each cell store contains an optional Bloom
Filter.  The Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure that can
indicate, with high probability, if a key is present and also indicate
definitively if a key is not present.  By mapping the bloom filters, for each
cell store in memory, queries can be made much more efficient because only the
cell stores that contain the row are searched.

The bloom filter specification can take one of the following forms.  The `rows`
form, which is the default, causes only row keys to be inserted into the bloom
filter.  The `rows+cols` form causes the row key concatenated with the column
family to be inserted into the bloom filter.  `none` disables the bloom
filter.

  * `rows [ bloom_filter_options ]`
  * `rows+cols [ bloom_filter_options ]`
  * `none`

The following table describes the bloom filter options:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Default</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre> --false-positive arg </pre></td>
<td><pre> 0.01 </pre></td>
<td>Expected false positive probability</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre> --max-approx-items arg </pre></td>
<td><pre> 1000 </pre></td>
<td>Number of cell store items used to guess the number of actual Bloom filter
entries</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

### Compressors
<p>
The cell store blocks within an access group are compressed using the
compression codec that is specified for the access group.  The following
compression codecs are available:

  * `bmz`
  * `lzo`
  * `quicklz`
  * `zlib`
  * `none`

The default code is `lzo` for cell store blocks.  The following tables describe
the available options.

<table border="1">
<caption><code>bmz</code> codec options</caption>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Default</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre> --fp-len arg </pre></td>
<td><pre> 19 </pre></td>
<td>Minimum fingerprint length</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre> --offset arg </pre></td>
<td><pre> 0 </pre></td>
<td>Starting fingerprint offset</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

<table border="1">
<caption><code>zlib</code> codec options</caption>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre> -9 [ --best ] </pre></td>
<td>Highest compression ratio (at the cost of speed)</td>

<td>Normal compression ratio</td>
</tr>
